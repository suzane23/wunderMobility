Hey!

When first running the app, you will realize that the map will not show up since the Google Maps key is missing.
On your Logcat an error like this will appear:
Android Application (<cert_fingerprint>;<package_name>): XX:F3:74:E4:47:07:E9:9B:84:DB:C1:28:38:23:AD:84:70:DD:D5:YY;com.wundermobility.qatest

You have then to create an Google Maps API Key with this data.
You can do that by changing YOUR_CERT_FINGERPRINT_HERE in the link below, for the one found in the Logcat .
https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=YOUR_CERT_FINGERPRINT_HERE;com.wundermobility.qatest

For instance for the example below would be:
https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=XX:F3:74:E4:47:07:E9:9B:84:DB:C1:28:38:23:AD:84:70:DD:D5:YY;com.wundermobility.qatest

Or alternatively in https://console.cloud.google.com/apis

Create a new project and setup the API Key.

With the API Key created.
Go to /app/src/main/res/values/keys.xml
Paste the key within google_maps_key tags.

Run the project and you should be able to see the map!

Good luck with your task!
